//! CD-ROM interface
//!
//! The PlayStation uses an external controller for decoding and
//! correcting CD sectors. This controller is similar to the CXD1199AQ
//! whose datasheet is available online. I try to use the symbolic
//! names defined in this datasheet where it makes sense.
//!
//! This controller communicates asynchronously with a microcontroller
//! handling actual CD-ROM drive (called the "sub-CPU" in the
//! CXD1199AQ datasheet).
//!
//! Since you can't access the sub-CPU directly from the main CPU it's
//! pretty difficult to reverse-engineer what's going on exactly
//! without using an oscilloscope. As a result this implementation is
//! based on No$'s specs, mednafen's source code and some educated
//! guesses.
